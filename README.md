# Welcome to my Portfolio!

My name is Lydia and this is my very-much-in-progress personal website. I started coding two years ago during my sophomore year of college. Between four semesters of college, two internships, and endless youtube tutorials, I've started to make my way in the world of tech - and what better way to further those skills than with my own portfolio website.
